# Small Vanilla JavaScript Projects

Several small web apps to make me learn and understand building software more. These primary made me understand the ease up frameworks do! It's literally like manual and automatic cars.

## Apps

- Counter App.
- Image Gallery App.

Only used Gen AI for CSS code, JS code was 100% me.
